Pure Virtual Function / Abstract Function
A function without implementation.
Function declaration = 0;
=> State where function is not implemented
Purpose is inheritance. Appropriately implemented in derived subclasses

Abstract Class
A class containing one or more pure virtual functions. Incomplete class.
Cannot create objects.
Must implement all pure virtual functions in derived classes to create objects.

=> Provides outline to subclasses. All inherited abstract functions must be implemented

Multiple Inheritance
Inheriting from multiple parent classes
class Child: Parent1, Parent2... {

}

Advantages: Powerful. Can use various attributes and functions.
Disadvantages: Diamond-shaped inheritance causes ambiguity => error

Operator Overloading
Modify operators to work with custom classes
*Member functions
*Global functions

____
Templates
Writing comprehensive code. Generalized coding.
Function template: Defining functions generally

template
T1 function(T1 a, T2 b){
cout<<a<<b<<endl;
return a;
}
