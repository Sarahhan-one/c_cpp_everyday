<Exception Handling>

Exception: 
A problem that occurs during program execution. The default behavior is termination.
Division by zero, null pointer exceptions, freeing already freed memory...

Exception handling: 
A structure that prevents program termination when exceptions occur and allows the code to continue execution
Problem occurs => Exception thrown => Exception caught and handled

Exception handling syntax
- try: Contains code that might throw exceptions
- throw: Raises an exception. When invalid code is detected, an exception is raised/thrown
- catch : Handles exceptions thrown from the try block
A catch block only receives exception objects of the same parameter type
- catch(...) block: Catches all exceptions
